<h2>Publication Venue Canonicalization Data v1.0</h2>

6/6/07 The data is available here: <a
href="canonicalization_data_v1.0.tgz">canonicalization_data_v1.0.tgz</a>
(md5sum = 1752b38bbe66d99af38a429a3b157bbd)

<p> This data contains lists of conference and journal names culled from the Web by <a href="http://www.rexa.info">Rexa</a>. Given a set of strings referring to the same conference or journal, the task is to determine which string should be the <b>canonical</b> one. The canonical string should be free of spelling, segmentation, and OCR errors, and should in some sense be prototypical of the entity.

<p> For more details, see <a href="../pubs/culotta07canonicalization.pdf">this paper</a>.</p> 
	
<p>Strings referring to different venues are separated by a blank line. The first string in a list of venues is the one that has been manually annotated as canonical.
For example, in the block
<br>
<font face="courier" size="-1">
in proceedings of the ninth national conference on artificial intelligence<br>
in proc 9th conf aaai<br>
in proceedings of the ninth national conference on artifici al intelligence<br>
</font>
<br>The first string is the canonical one.

<p> Because the canonical string is in some sense subjective, the data has two sets of labels, located in separate directories:
<li> <i>long</i> - The canonical string is the long, full venue name (e.g., National Conference on Artificial Intelligence)
<li> <i>short</i> - The canonical string is the abbreviated venue name (e.g., AAAI)
<br><br>
Each directory is also split into 5 cross-validation sets (e.g., <i>long/train.1</i> and <i>long/test.1</i> are one split).

<p>
Some statistics about the data:
<li> 3,683 venue strings
<li> 100 unique venues
<li> 32,556 tokens
